- Save time by automating menu checking  
- Reduce decision fatigue  
- Improve the daily campus dining experience

## ⚙️ Technical Foundation

The system uses a **multi-level keyword matching pipeline** that combines:

| Matching Level | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Direct string matching** | Checks if the exact user input appears in the menu text |
| **2. Category synonym matching** | Maps user input to predefined category synonyms to catch variations |
| **3. Fuzzy matching** | Allows spelling mistakes from user input |
| **4. Semantic matching** | Captures meaning-based similarity using text embeddings |

The application runs as a **Streamlit web interface** and uses a **scheduler** to perform automatic daily checks at 7 AM.
